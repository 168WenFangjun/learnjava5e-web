# learnjava5e-web
Code examples for the web portion of Chapter 12, from Learning Java, 5e by Marc Loy, Patrick Niemeyer, and Daniel Leuck

The web section on servlets requires use of the servlet-api.jar file so we've broken out the examples
into two repositories. The first contains the bulk of the examples from the book and can be cloned and
quickly imported into any IDE. This repo can also be imported, of course, but you'll need to add the
servlet-api.jar to your IDE's classpath as well.
